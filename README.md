# cloth-demo

In this repo I have a report describing the project, my final presentation, a video of the implementation, and my codebase.

executable and the code for this special demo are inside the codebase/projectiveDynamics folder. I had to upload other unrelated folders to not break by cmake files but feel free to ignore them.

you can build the project using Cmake:
`
  mkdir build
   cd build
  cmake ..
  make -j8
`
You can also watch the video from Youtube:
